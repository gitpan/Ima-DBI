Revision history for Perl extension Ima::DBI.

0.18  Thu Mar 16 16:04:11 EST 2000
    * Ooops, bug in fetch_hash() in list context.

0.17  Tue Feb 29 00:13:32 EST 2000
    * set_sql() and sql_*() will now deal with dynamic SQL statements much
      better.
    - Fixed up the docs a bit.
    - execute() no longer checks for taintedness on bind parameters.

0.16  1999/12/29 06:37:03
    * Added a real DBIwarn()
    - Never released to CPAN.

0.15  1999/12/14 23:33:37
    - Minor efficiency improvement of set_db().
    - Minor adjustment to set_sql() so that the generated method calls
      db_*() internaly instead of holding the $dbh inside the closure.
      This allows subclasses to override the db_*() for that particular
      sql method (needed for Class::DBI)

0.14  1999/12/08 00:56:58
    * fetchall_hash() was incorrectly coded as fetchall_hashref().

0.13  1999/09/26 21:53:27
    * DBI::st::bind_columns() was being called improperly
