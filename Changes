sql_* closures now use the $Statements{$name}{'sth'} to hold individual
object's statement handles, using the $self reference as a key.  This is a
hack, but Perl's OO requires hacks to avoid key collisions with sub classes.
(Thanks Roderick)

sql_* accidentally accepted (but did nothing with) an argument.  Fixed.

Naming of the closure was incorrectly done.  Fixed.

SYNOPSIS errors fixed.

L<> flakiness fixed, and other little POD quirks.  Fixed.

DBI::Ima::sth::_getDBH() will silently ignore named connections which have
not yet been connected (no $dbh defined).  Should this toss a warning?

DBI::Ima::_connect() forgot to pull $self out of @_.  Silly me.  Fixed.
